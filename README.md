ShadeX - Cryptojacking
#### The project is still in its preliminary phase.


# Description
#####  ShadeX is a cryptojacking application project. The application is made for research purposes only.

# ShadeX_Client
##### ShadeX_Client is a client that copies cryptocurrency monero. Why monero? because it is completely anonymous and censorship-resistant. This makes Monero a favorite of the dark net and cryptojacking hackers.The application communicates with ShadeX_Server via the http server why? honestly, I don't know, it was easy for me to write an api to communicate with a server that is based on free hosting with sql database

# ShadeX HTTP Server
##### http server is used for communication and data storage using simple php scripts and maintenance of sql database. I hate php
