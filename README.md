ShadeX - Cryptojacking
#### The project is still in its preliminary phase.


# Description
#####  ShadeX is a cryptojacking application project. The application is made for research purposes only.



# ShadeX_Client
##### ShadeX_Client is a client that copies cryptocurrency monero. Why monero? because it is completely anonymous and censorship-resistant. This makes Monero a favorite of the dark net and cryptojacking hackers.The application communicates with ShadeX_Server via the http server why? honestly, I don't know, it was easy for me to write an api to communicate with a server that is based on free hosting with sql database

# ShadeX_Server
##### ShadeX_Server is used to handle infected computers, I can change the mining parameters and adjust the configuration appropriate to each client or after pressing a few buttons change the type of cryptocurrency to mine (there is no such function yet, but this is the plan). Communication takes place via the http server using POST requests.

# ShadeX HTTP Server
##### http server is used for communication and data storage using simple php scripts and maintenance of sql database. I hate php

# Any idea?
##### As this is a learning project I would love to know what I am doing wrong or what I could improve. Maybe someone has some ideas for improving this project.
